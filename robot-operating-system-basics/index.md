## Getting started with Robot Operating System (ROS)

This guide is created to help you get started with [ROS]. ROS is a framework for writing software for robots. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up ROS, create a workspace, and create a package. The package will contain a simple node that prints a message to the terminal.

Links to relevant material are provided throughout the tutorial. The tutorial is written for [Ubuntu] 22.04 and [ROS 2 Humble]. However, the tutorial should be applicable to other versions of Ubuntu and ROS.
