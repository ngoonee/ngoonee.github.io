## Robot Operating System (ROS) Simulation

In this section we will be looking at using Gazebo for robot simulation. Gazebo is a 3D simulator that can be used to simulate robots and environments. It is commonly used in robotics research and education. Gazebo can be used to simulate the robot's physical environment and the robot itself. It can also be used to simulate the robot's sensors and actuators. Gazebo can be used to simulate the robot's physical environment and the robot itself. It can also be used to simulate the robot's sensors and actuators. You can learn more about gazebo in this link [http://gazebosim.org/](http://gazebosim.org/).

Follow this link to install Gazebo on your computer [https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu). We will be using Gazebo Garden for the simulation. Ensure that you have that install before moving on.
